Make class Employee and its initialization method. Employee-class
will have 2 attributes: id and name.

Make program, which:

fills the vector (vector<Employee>) with objects of Employee class. Id is a serial
 number from 1 and name will be asked from user and is given in a form "Firstname Surname".
 Use getline (cin,name) to read name.
ends when user gives '0' instead of a name.

Please enter employee name (0 to quit): John Johnson
Please enter employee name (0 to quit): Richard Roe
Please enter employee name (0 to quit): 0
Id: 1 Name: Jane Doe
Id: 2 Name: John Johnson
Id: 3 Name: Richard Roe
