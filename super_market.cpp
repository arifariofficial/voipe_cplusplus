/*
Make simple Supermarket -program,

having 10 products with prices in an array of integers as follows:
int prodprices[] = { 10, 14, 22, 33, 44, 13, 22, 55, 66, 77 };
asking (cin >> prodnbr) product number from 1 to 10 and summing its price to totalsum
and printing product number and price for every product as in example.
asking products until user gives '0' to quit the program (do while-loop).
printing  "Total:" and the total sum of prices.
asking "Payment:" from user and printing "Change:" and finally
calculating and printing the amount of change (payment - totalsum) to customer.

You must use in this program: [], while, cin, cout, endl

Example output:
Supermarket

Please select product (1-10) 0 to Quit: 1
Product: 1 Price: 10
Please select product (1-10) 0 to Quit: 6
Product: 6 Price: 13
